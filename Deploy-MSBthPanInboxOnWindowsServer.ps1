.SYNOPSIS
    Microsoft inbox Bluetooth PAN (bthpan) driver Build/Verify/Install
    deployment pipeline for Windows Server 2016 / 2019 / 2022 / 2025.

.DESCRIPTION
    21-phase pipeline that takes the Microsoft inbox Bluetooth PAN
    driver (bthpan.inf / bthpan.sys, shipped with every Windows but
    filtered out on Server SKUs by the [Manufacturer] decoration
    `NTamd64...1` which restricts the entry to ProductType=1
    Workstation) and deploys it on a Windows SERVER SKU. The pipeline:

      Build (P00..P09): Copy bthpan.inf / bthpan.sys / catalog from the
                        host's DriverStore, patch the INF with
                        ProductType=3 (Server) decorations, regenerate
                        a fresh catalog with inf2cat, and sign it with
                        a SELF-SIGNED code-signing certificate created
                        by this script.

      Verify (V01..V06): Confirm the build's correctness - certificate
                         chain, catalog signatures, INF decoration
                         coverage - then dry-run the install phases
                         and produce a per-device AS-IS / TO-BE
                         analysis. The critical V06 check is the
                         Phantom-OK detection: even when the host's
                         BTH\MS_BTHPAN device reports Status=OK, the
                         underlying bthpan.sys may not actually be
                         loaded (a generic bth.inf may have proxy-
                         matched). V06 explicitly distinguishes the
                         two cases.

      Install (I00..I04): Trust the cert into LocalMachine\Root +
                          TrustedPublisher, authorize the cert as a
                          kernel-mode signer via a WDAC supplemental
                          policy (Secure Boot stays ON), call pnputil
                          for the patched bthpan.inf, scan-devices to
                          force rebinding, and verify that bthpan.sys
                          is now loaded with Class=Net and
                          Service=BthPan (the "true resolution" state).

    ====================================================================
    SCOPE (read this first)
    ====================================================================
    This script handles ONLY the Microsoft inbox `bthpan.inf` /
    `bthpan.sys` enablement. It does NOT touch vendor Bluetooth host
    controller drivers (Intel / Realtek / Broadcom etc.). The host's
    Bluetooth host controller (e.g. Intel AX210, Realtek RTL8852, etc.)
    is assumed to already be properly bound and showing Status=OK in
    Device Manager before this script runs.

    The symptom this script solves: on a Windows Server SKU with a
    working Bluetooth host controller, Device Manager shows
    `BTH\MS_BTHPAN` as an unknown device (code 28). The root cause is
    that Microsoft's inbox `bthpan.inf` declares only the Workstation
    decoration `NTamd64...1`, which Windows Server (ProductType=3)
    filters out during PnP matching. As a result:

        1. bthpan.inf's `BthPan.Install` section (AddService, CopyFiles,
           AddReg) never runs.
        2. bthpan.sys is never copied to C:\Windows\System32\drivers.
        3. The BthPan service is never registered.
        4. No Bluetooth PAN network adapter (Class=Net) is created.

    This script's fix mirrors the existing `NTamd64...1` Workstation
    decoration with `NTamd64...3` Server decoration via the same INF
    patching technique that the sister AMD scripts use for AMD's
    consumer driver INFs.

    ====================================================================
    THE PHANTOM-OK PROBLEM (why simple pnputil /add-driver is not enough)
    ====================================================================
    Running ASUS FAQ's "Update driver -> Microsoft -> Personal Area
    Network Service" or `pnputil /add-driver /install` against the
    inbox bthpan.inf appears to succeed: BTH\MS_BTHPAN shows
    Status=OK in Device Manager afterwards. However, this is a Phantom
    OK state: a generic bth.inf has been used as a proxy match, but
    bthpan.sys is NOT actually loaded and the BthPan service is NOT
    actually running. PAN networking functionality is still broken.

    True resolution requires the [Manufacturer] decoration to include
    `NTamd64...3` so that bthpan.inf itself (not bth.inf) matches the
    device. V06 / I04 in this script enumerate the device properties
    `DEVPKEY_Device_DriverInfPath`, `DEVPKEY_Device_Class`, and
    `DEVPKEY_Device_Service` to distinguish Phantom OK from true
    resolution:

        DEVPKEY_Device_DriverInfPath  Phantom: bth.inf   True: oem<N>.inf
        DEVPKEY_Device_Class          Phantom: Bluetooth True: Net
        DEVPKEY_Device_Service        Phantom: (empty)   True: BthPan

    ====================================================================
    Pipeline phases (21 phases shared with sister AMD scripts)
    ====================================================================
    PREPARATION (idempotent, file artifacts only under -WorkRoot):
      P00 Initialize         Admin check, TLS, OS detection, env display
      P01 PrepareWorkspace   Create / optionally clean working directories
      P02 AcquireTools       Install Windows SDK / Windows WDK
      P03 FetchInstaller     Locate bthpan.inf in the host DriverStore
                             (no network download; the "installer" is
                             the host's own DriverStore copy)
      P04 ExtractInstaller   Copy bthpan.inf / .sys / .cat from
                             DriverStore to the workspace extract dir
      P05 AnalyzeInfs        Inventory the single bthpan.inf into CSV
      P06 PatchInfs          Generate ProductType=3 patched bthpan.inf
      P07 CreateCertificate  Generate self-signed cert files (PFX/CER)
      P08 GenerateCatalogs   inf2cat to regenerate the .cat file
                             (targets ALL 4 Server SKUs in /os:)
      P09 SignCatalogs       signtool to sign the .cat file

    VERIFICATION (read-only diagnostics, no system / file changes):
      V01 VerifyArtifacts    Existence of PFX/CER/INF/CAT
      V02 VerifyCertificate  Cert validity, EKU, private key
      V03 VerifyCatalogs     signtool /verify /pa on the .cat
      V04 VerifyInfs         INF parsing + ProductType=3 decoration check
      V05 DryRunInstall      Simulate I03 without modifying state
      V06 HardwareImpactAnalysis
                             BTH\MS_BTHPAN current-state diagnosis,
                             Phantom-OK detection, true-resolution
                             readiness check

    INSTALLATION (modifies system state):
      I00 PreInstallReview   Final review, risk summary
      I01 TrustCertificate   Import cert to LocalMachine\Root + TrustedPublisher
      I02 AuthorizeDriverSigning
                             Authorize self-signed driver loading.
                             Default path: WDAC supplemental policy.
      I03 InstallDrivers     pnputil /add-driver bthpan.inf /install
                             then pnputil /scan-devices to force
                             rebinding from the proxy bth.inf to the
                             patched bthpan.inf.
      I04 PostInstallVerification
                             True-resolution check: DriverInfPath
                             must be oem<N>.inf (not bth.inf),
                             Class must be Net, Service must be
                             BthPan, bthpan.sys must exist in
                             System32\drivers, BthPan service must
                             be registered, a PAN NetAdapter must
                             appear.

    All preparation phases are idempotent: re-running produces the same
    output. Each phase writes a marker file when complete; with -Force
    the marker is ignored and the phase re-runs from scratch.
    -CleanWorkRoot deletes the entire working directory before starting.

    ====================================================================
    RESUME AFTER REBOOT (just re-run the same command)
    ====================================================================
    Install phases I01/I02/I03 each START by inspecting the live system
    to see if their target end state is already present. If yes, the
    phase prints "Target state already holds - skipped" and moves on
    to the next phase. This means a single command works for all stages:

        # First run:
        .\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action Install

        # If a reboot was requested, reboot, then re-run THE SAME
        # command. The script auto-detects which phases are already
        # done and continues from where it left off:
        .\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action Install

    ====================================================================
    COEXISTENCE WITH SISTER AMD SCRIPTS
    ====================================================================
    This script (MS BthPan) is designed to live alongside the
    Deploy-AMD{Chipset,Graphics,Npu}DriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 sister
    scripts on the same host without conflict. Three design decisions
    enable this:

    [1] Working directory is fully separated.
        Default for THIS script   : C:\Temp\Workspace_Microsoft-BthPan
        Default for chipset/grx/npu: C:\Temp\Workspace_AMD-{Chipset,Graphics,NPU}
        (all four scripts relocated under C:\Temp\Workspace_*; see
        the per-script change notes for the original paths.)
        Each workspace owns its own .markers/, cert/, download/,
        extracted/, patched/, logs/ subtrees.

    [2] Self-signed certificate is per-script (NOT shared).
        Subject CN includes "BthPan" so certmgr.msc, the signed
        catalog files, and the WDAC supplemental policy all
        unambiguously identify which script the cert belongs to.

    [3] WDAC supplemental policy GUID is per-script (NOT shared).
        bthpan: A6E72D4F-3B98-4C5A-9E1D-7F8B2A4C6E5D
        chipset: 503860EA-... / graphics: 85336828-... / npu: 8B2C4F12-...

.PARAMETER Action
    Phase action selector. Default 'PrepareVerify' runs P00..V06
    without modifying system state.

.PARAMETER OnlyPhases
    Restrict execution to specific phases. Accepts IDs ('P05')
    or short names ('PatchInfs').

.PARAMETER WorkRoot
    Workspace directory. Default: C:\Temp\Workspace_Microsoft-BthPan
    (relocated under C:\Temp\Workspace_* to keep workspace data
    clustered under one parent directory that is trivial to inspect and
    purge. The script auto-creates C:\Temp on demand.)

.PARAMETER LogFile
    Optional path to capture the full console transcript to a
    file. When set, the script wraps its execution in
    Start-Transcript / Stop-Transcript so the file receives every
    stream (Output / Host / Error / Warning / Verbose / Debug) as
    plain text, while the interactive console keeps its color
    decoration (Write-Host -ForegroundColor) intact. This is the
    recommended way to retain a run log without losing console
    colors — Tee-Object on the outside of the pipeline strips
    Write-Host coloring, this option does not.

    The parent directory is created on demand. The file is opened
    in -Append mode so concurrent re-runs accumulate rather than
    truncate. Recommended filename convention:
        C:\Temp\ms-bthpan_<Action>_<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>.log

.PARAMETER CleanWorkRoot
    Wipe the workspace directory before starting.

.PARAMETER UseTestSigning
    Fall back to `bcdedit /set testsigning on` instead of WDAC
    supplemental policy. Requires Secure Boot OFF.

.PARAMETER AllowWorkstationInstall
    Permit Install phases on Workstation OS (ProductType=1).
    Default: blocked.

.PARAMETER PfxPassword
    Password for the self-signed PFX. Default: 'ChangeMe!2026'.

.PARAMETER TimestampUrl
    RFC 3161 timestamp server for signtool /tr.

.PARAMETER DecorationStrategy
    INF patching strategy:
      - 'A' (default): add only NTamd64...3 (ProductType=3, covers
                       all Server SKUs)
      - 'B'          : add NTamd64.10.0...14393 / 17763 / 20348 /
                       26100 explicitly (per-build entries)

.EXAMPLE
    .\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action PrepareVerify
    Dry-run: prepare patched INF + signed catalog, verify, but do
    not modify system state.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action Install
    Full install on a Windows Server SKU.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action All -CleanWorkRoot
    Clean rebuild and full install in one command.

.EXAMPLE
    # Capture full transcript while keeping console colors
    $ts  = Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss'
    $log = "C:\Temp\ms-bthpan_PrepareVerify_$ts.log"
    .\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer.ps1 `
        -Action PrepareVerify -CleanWorkRoot `
        -LogFile $log

.EXAMPLE
    # Legacy fallback (color is stripped from the captured file)
    .\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action Install *>&1 |
        Tee-Object -FilePath "C:\Temp\ms-bthpan_Install_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss').log"

    # RECOMMENDED PATTERN: place transcripts OUTSIDE -WorkRoot with a

    # SAFETY NET: if -LogFile resolves to a path INSIDE -WorkRoot AND
    # -CleanWorkRoot is set, the script auto-relocates the transcript
    # to its own directory (or %TEMP% as fallback) with a timestamp-
    # suffixed filename and warns the user. This prevents the

#
# Tee-Object on the outside of the pipeline (`... *>&1 | Tee-Object`)
# strips Write-Host coloring because the host stream is captured into

# alternative when console coloring matters to the operator.
#
# Transcript verified activation:
#
#   Reports from PS 5.1.26100.32860 (Windows Server 2025) showed that
#   `Start-Transcript -Path X -Append -Force` raised
#   ParameterBindingException ("Parameter set cannot be resolved using
#   the specified named parameters") only when invoked from the actual
#   BthPan script body. Isolated minimal reproductions (clean session,
#   same param block in a separate small.ps1) all succeeded. The
#   root cause for the script-context-specific failure could not be
#   pinpointed within a reasonable budget; instead, takes a
#   defense-in-depth approach:
#
#     1. CAPTURE the cmdlet return value (a non-empty localized success
#        message proves the cmdlet completed normally).
#     2. POLL the log file's appearance on disk with a short timeout
#        (3 s default, 50 ms interval) - Start-Transcript opens the
#        file before returning, so a missing file means the transcript
#        did not actually start.
#     3. WRITE a probe marker via Write-Output, briefly Start-Sleep,
#        then read the file back and confirm the marker landed there.
#        This is the only deterministic way to know transcription is
#        actively capturing output (vs. silently dropping it).
#     4. STOP-TRANSCRIPT + Start-Sleep BETWEEN failed attempts so a
#        partially-initialized state from one attempt does not
#        contaminate the next.
#     5. RECORD per-attempt failure metadata (exception type, FQId,
#        message) so post-mortem diagnosis has enough material.
#
#   A failed transcript activation MUST NEVER prevent the script from
#   running its actual work. If activation fails, the script proceeds
#   uncaptured with a prominent warning and a Tee-Object workaround.

# Auto-relocation guard for -LogFile vs -WorkRoot + -CleanWorkRoot
#####################################################################
# When the operator specifies a -LogFile path that resolves to a
# location INSIDE -WorkRoot AND -CleanWorkRoot is also requested, the
# P01 PrepareWorkspace phase would attempt Remove-Item on the WorkRoot
# subtree while Start-Transcript holds the transcript file open in
# write mode. That produces an IOException
# ("FileInfo: another process is using this file") partway through
# the recursive delete, leaving the workspace in a half-deleted
# state.
#
# Instead of throwing, we auto-relocate the transcript to a safe
# path (this script's own directory, falling back to %TEMP%) with a
# timestamp-suffixed filename. The user's transcript intent is
# preserved; only the LOCATION is corrected. A prominent Write-Warning
# is emitted so the new path is visible. Both the original and new
# paths are also recorded on $Script:LogFileSetup for the RUN
# SUMMARY.
#
# Trigger: $LogFile is non-empty AND $CleanWorkRoot AND $LogFile
#             resolves to a sub-path of $WorkRoot
# Target: <script-dir>\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer_<Action>_<ts>.log
# Fallback: %TEMP%\Deploy-MSBthPanInboxOnWindowsServer_<Action>_<ts>.log
#             when script-dir is unavailable
#
# The intentional design choice is "relocate, do not refuse" so a
# benign user mistake (putting transcript next to its peer artifacts
# under logs\) does not block the run. The P01 pre-flight guard below
# stays as a defense-in-depth backstop in case this relocation logic
# itself fails to apply for any reason.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Mid-prominence section header used within a phase to delimit
        major logical groups of output (e.g. "Section A: ..." inside
        I00 PreInstallReview, or "Section 1: ..." inside I04 / V06).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Visually less weighty than Write-PhaseHeader (no horizontal
        rules, no banner), but more prominent than Write-Step (cyan
        with a leading double-dash). Always preceded by a blank line
        for breathing room.

        Defined in a previous update. Calls to this helper were in place from
        an earlier refactor but the function definition was lost in
        merge; calls survived undetected because they only exist inside
        V05 (DryRunInstall), V06 (HardwareImpactAnalysis), I00
        (PreInstallReview), and I04 (PostInstallVerification) - phases
        that the -Action Prepare smoke tests never reached.

# SECTION 1b: Debug Trace Facility
#####################################################################
# A reusable diagnostic helper used to pinpoint the exact failing
# operation inside a complex function body, with three integrated
# subsystems:
#
#   (1) Trace primitives: Start-DebugTrace / Set-DebugStep /
#                           Stop-DebugTrace / Format-DebugFailure /
#                           Write-DebugFailureReport
#   (2) JSONL file output: Real-time append-only event stream to
#                           <WorkRoot>\logs\debugtrace.jsonl
#   (3) JSON Export: Point-in-time snapshot with full state,
#                           used manually and auto-triggered on phase
#                           failure.
#
# Motivation: investigation of Invoke-InfVerifValidation - the
# function raised System.ArgumentException but the stack trace only
# identified the function, not the line. By instrumenting with
# $debugStep checkpoints and a catch handler that reported the step
# name + exception type + message + script stack, the failure was
# localised to a single line (the `return [pscustomobject]@{...}`
# statement) and from there to a PS 5.1 ja-JP locale bug. This section
# generalises that ad-hoc pattern into a reusable facility that any
# function in this script (or sister scripts) can adopt.
#
# Typical usage pattern (function entry/body/catch/finally):
#
#   function Invoke-Something {
#       Start-DebugTrace -Context 'Invoke-Something'
#       try {
#           Set-DebugStep 'validate inputs'
#           ...
#           Set-DebugStep 'open file'
#           ...
#           Set-DebugStep 'parse content'
#           ...
#           Set-DebugStep 'return result'
#           return $result
#       } catch {
#           Write-DebugFailureReport $_ -IncludeStepHistory
#           throw
#       } finally {
#           Stop-DebugTrace
#       }
#   }
#
# Nesting: traces stack via Stack<object>; nested traced functions
# don't stomp on each other's state. Format-DebugFailure always
# reports against the frame that was at the top of the stack at the
# moment the exception was caught (= the function whose catch block
# is running).
#
# Phase integration: the top-level phase dispatcher loop wraps every
# phase invocation in Start-DebugTrace / Stop-DebugTrace with the
# phase ID as context (e.g. 'phase.P05.AnalyzeInfs'). Any Set-DebugStep
# inside the phase body is automatically attributed to that frame.
# On phase failure, the dispatcher emits Write-DebugFailureReport and
# triggers Export-DebugTraceJson automatically when auto-export is on.

    # Refactor for robustness on PS 5.1 ja-JP. The previous
    # implementation used inline `if/else` expressions as hashtable values
    # and a property named `host` (which collides with the PS auto-
    # variable name in some parser contexts). User report on
    # 2026-05-17 showed AmbiguousParameterSet failure when
    # -ExportTraceOnExit triggered this function from the finally block.
    # This refactor:
    #   1. Pre-computes every hashtable value into a local variable so
    #      no `if/else` expression appears inside [pscustomobject]@{...}.
    #   2. Renames the `host` key to `hostInfo` defensively.
    #   3. Uses [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)] (explicit boolean) instead
    #      of bare [Parameter(Mandatory)] which is normally equivalent
    #      but has been observed to fail parameter-set resolution on
    #      some PS 5.1 builds.
    #   4. Adds Section 1b's Start-DebugTrace / Set-DebugStep instrumen-
    #      tation so any future failure surfaces the failing step name
    #      in the JSONL stream even if the JSON export itself can't be

# SECTION 1c: Boot-signing environment (Secure Boot / testsigning /
# HVCI / VBS / Memory Integrity)
#####################################################################
# These helpers inspect every system-level setting that controls
# whether a self-signed kernel-mode driver can load. They are read-only
# and intended to be called from:
#   - Show-PowerShellEnvironment (P00 startup banner, compact line)
#   - I00 PreInstallReview (dedicated section with AS-IS / TO-BE)
#   - I02 AuthorizeDriverSigning (pre-check + AS-IS / TO-BE)
#   - I04 PostInstallVerification (post-reboot effective state)
#
# Why this matters for this script:
#   This script signs catalogs with a SELF-SIGNED certificate (P07).
#   Windows will refuse to load a kernel-mode driver bound to such a
#   catalog UNLESS:
#     (a) Secure Boot is OFF in firmware (UEFI setup) AND
#     (b) BCD testsigning is ON (set by I02, takes effect at boot) AND
#     (c) HVCI / Memory Integrity is OFF (otherwise CI policy still
#         enforces Microsoft-rooted signing)
#   If ANY of (a), (b), (c) is wrong, the user can run pnputil all day
#   and the driver will load briefly then be refused / reverted.
#
# Secure Boot can ONLY be disabled in firmware (UEFI setup), not from
# Windows. This script can detect, instruct, and refuse to enable
# testsigning when Secure Boot is on (because the bcdedit setting
# would be silently dropped on next boot).
#####################################################################
# SECTION 1d: UEFI Secure Boot certificate baseline
#####################################################################
# Captures the runtime UEFI Secure Boot certificate / servicing state
# and (when present) hands off to Microsoft's official sample script
# %SystemRoot%\SecureBoot\ExampleRolloutScripts\Detect-SecureBootCertUpdateStatus.ps1
# for additional fleet-rollout telemetry (BucketId / ConfidenceLevel /
# event-log counts).
#
# Why this matters for this script:
#   This script's drivers ride on top of UEFI Secure Boot. The UEFI db
#   and KEK variables hold the firmware-level trust anchors. From mid-
#   2026 onward, Microsoft is rolling out new UEFI CA 2023 certificates
#   to replace the 2011 ones that begin expiring in June 2026.
#   While our self-signed driver chain is at a HIGHER layer than UEFI
#   (Windows cert stores + WDAC supplemental CI policy), a host with an
#   incomplete or errored UEFI cert update is a meaningful diagnostic
#   signal: bootloader trust may be in flux, the Secure-Boot-Update
#   scheduled task may be running concurrently, and rollback / BitLocker
#   prompts become more likely if I02 / I03 fire in that window.
#
# Two information sources, fused via a "hybrid C" pattern (per user choice):
#
#   1. Embedded path (always available):
#        - Confirm-SecureBootUEFI + Get-SecureBootUEFI db / kek
#        - HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecureBoot
#        - HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecureBoot\Servicing
#        - \Microsoft\Windows\PI\Secure-Boot-Update scheduled task
#
#   2. Microsoft sample path (best-effort, only on devices that received
#      KB5089549 / KB5087544 / KB5088863 or the WS2025 equivalent):
#        - %SystemRoot%\SecureBoot\ExampleRolloutScripts\Detect-SecureBootCertUpdateStatus.ps1
#      Adds BucketId / ConfidenceLevel / SkipReason / event-1801-1808
#      counts that we cannot reasonably reimplement here.
#
# Reference:
#   - Sample Secure Boot E2E Automation Guide (Microsoft KB 5084567)

# SECTION 1e: WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control)
# supplemental-policy helpers
#####################################################################
# These helpers exist to keep Secure Boot ENABLED while still allowing
# this script's self-signed code-signing certificate to load
# kernel-mode drivers. The mechanism is a WDAC "supplemental" Code
# Integrity policy:
#
#   - The base CI policy (default Windows policy) keeps enforcing
#     Microsoft-rooted signing.
#   - A supplemental policy is deployed alongside the base, ADDING the
#     self-signed cert as an allowed kernel-mode signer.
#   - On Server 2022+/Windows 11, CiTool.exe activates the supplemental
#     immediately (no reboot). On older systems, a reboot is required.
#
# Why this is preferable to bcdedit testsigning:
#   testsigning is silently dropped at boot when Secure Boot is on.
#   The user would have to disable Secure Boot in firmware - which
#   weakens the platform and may force BitLocker recovery.
#   WDAC supplemental policies are the supported, documented path to
#   "trust this additional publisher" with Secure Boot still on.
#
# Required platform components (all present on WS2022+ / WS2025):
#   - PowerShell 'ConfigCI' module (cmdlets: Add-SignerRule,
#                                             ConvertFrom-CIPolicy,
#                                             Set-CIPolicyIdInfo)
#   - C:\Windows\System32\CiTool.exe (immediate activation)
#   - WDAC AllowAll template under
#     C:\Windows\schemas\CodeIntegrity\ExamplePolicies\AllowAll.xml
#
# A marker file (Cert dir / 'MsBthPanSuppPolicyId.txt') records the
# deployed policy ID so we can detect & uninstall later.

# SECTION 1f: Install-phase state validators (resume-after-reboot)
#####################################################################
# These predicates answer "is the END STATE of install phase X already
# present on this system?" by inspecting the live system, NOT by
# checking marker files. They exist so that an install run can be
# safely re-executed (e.g. after a reboot) and skip phases whose work
# is already in place.
#
# Why state-based, not marker-based:
#   The phase-marker files in $Ctx.Paths.Markers tell us "this script
#   ran I01 successfully in some past run". They do NOT tell us
#   whether the change is still present. If the user manually deleted
#   the cert from certmgr.msc, or someone removed the WDAC policy
#   with CiTool, or pnputil's driver-store was cleared, the marker
#   would lie. State validation reads the actual current state, so
#   skip/run is decided correctly regardless of marker status.
#
# Combined helper Test-InstallPhaseAlreadyDone is the entry point
# install phases use at their top. It honours -Force (always returns
# $false so the work re-runs).
#
# These helpers are intentionally read-only and side-effect free.

#####################################################################
# On Windows Server 2019 (build 17763) and Windows Server 2016 (build
# 14393), the WDAC Multiple Policy Format (MPF) used by I02 Path A is
# unavailable (no CiTool.exe; Active\{GUID}.cip is not enumerated by
# the kernel). The I02 phase therefore delegates to a separate
# orchestrator script that implements Single Policy Format (SPF).
#
# The 5 helper functions in this section coordinate that delegation:
#   - canonical hash computation (BOM-strip + LF-normalize) so script
#     identity is stable across CRLF/LF storage variants
#   - resolving the orchestrator script path (co-located vs not)
#   - invoking the orchestrator in JSON-output mode and parsing the
#     envelope back into a [pscustomobject]
#   - top-level Invoke-LegacyWdacAuthorization entry point called from
#     I02 when Test-IsLegacyWindowsServerOs returns $true
#
# These functions are intentionally byte-for-byte identical across all
# four driver scripts AND the orchestrator. Future maintenance must
# update all five copies in lockstep (PSA8001 will flag drift once it
# has 2+ peers to compare).

# SECTION 5: BthPan device + DriverStore helpers
#####################################################################
#
# This section replaces the sister AMD scripts' "AMD URL discovery"
# section. The Microsoft inbox bthpan driver is NOT downloaded from
# any remote URL: it is already present on every Windows install at
# C:\Windows\INF\bthpan.inf and as a staged copy under
# C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\bthpan.inf_amd64_*.
# The functions in this section locate the staged DriverStore copy,
# diagnose the current BTH\MS_BTHPAN device state (Phantom OK vs true
# resolution vs unknown-device), and produce the device inventory that
# V05 / V06 / I04 consume.
#
#=======================================================================================================================

function Get-BthPanDriverStoreSource {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Locate the staged bthpan inbox driver folder under the
        DriverStore FileRepository.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Inbox drivers ship with Windows and are staged at
        C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\<inf>_amd64_<hash>.
        For bthpan there may be more than one staged copy (e.g. after
        a Windows feature update). We pick the most recently modified
        directory that contains bthpan.inf AND bthpan.sys.

        an earlier revision (WS2025 compatibility): the original .cat file is NOT
        required to be present in the FileRepository directory.
        On Windows Server 2025 (build 26100 family) Microsoft has
        changed the inbox-driver staging layout so that some
        FileRepository directories contain only the INF + SYS pair,
        with the corresponding Microsoft-signed catalog held in a
        separate CatRoot-side location (not in FileRepository).
        Because P08 always regenerates a fresh catalog via inf2cat
        and P09 re-signs it with this script's self-signed cert, the
        original .cat is informational only and does not need to be
        present at the staging-discovery step.

        Previously behaviour required >=1 .cat file in the FileRepository
        directory, which caused P03 to fail on a clean WS2025 install
        even though bthpan.inf and bthpan.sys were correctly staged.

function Get-BthPanNetChildBinding { # psa-disable-line PSA6003 -- compound noun (Bindings) is semantically plural for set-returning helpers
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Locate ANY Net-class device bound to the bthpan service, in a
        language-independent way.
    .DESCRIPTION
        When bthpan.inf (or its patched oem*.inf clone) binds successfully,
        the resulting NIC may appear via either of two device topologies:

          (a) Legacy: the BTH\MS_BTHPAN\<uid> parent device itself flips
              its Class from "Bluetooth" to "Net" and its Service to
              "BthPan". DriverInfPath then points to oem*.inf.

          (b) Modern (observed on WS2025): the BTH\MS_BTHPAN\<uid> parent
              remains as a "detached shell" (empty Class/Service/InfPath)
              while bthpan.sys is loaded against a SEPARATE Net-class
              device instance. The original Invoke-InstPhase04 only
              inspected the parent and therefore failed to recognise true
              resolution in this topology.

        This helper enumerates all Net-class devices on the host and
        returns those bound to bthpan.sys / ms_bthpan, using ONLY
        identifier fields that are NEVER localized:
          - DriverFileName  == 'bthpan.sys'
          - ComponentID     == 'ms_bthpan'
          - PnPDeviceID     matches /^BTH\\MS_BTHPAN(XFER)?\\/

        FriendlyName / InterfaceDescription are intentionally NOT used
        for matching (they are localized: e.g., Japanese WS2025 shows
        "Bluetooth デバイス (パーソナル エリア ネットワーク)"). They are
        returned in the result object for human-readable display only.
    .PARAMETER ExpectedSelfSignThumbprint
        Optional. When supplied, the helper also reads the bound
        driver's catalog signature via Get-AuthenticodeSignature and
        marks `IsSignedByUs = $true` when the leaf-cert thumbprint
        matches this value (typically $Ctx.CertThumbprint).
    .OUTPUTS
        Array of [pscustomobject] (empty array when no binding found).

    # double-quoted %Token% references). Although AMD chipset INFs
    # typically use form (a), this parser is kept in sync with the
    # graphics script for consistency and future-proofing.
    #
    #   (a) %Token% -- canonical AMD INF convention, where the
    #                        token resolves against [Strings]
    #                        Example: %D1638% = svcS, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_1638
    #
    #   (b) "Quoted lit" -- literal string in quotes, OR a quoted
    #                        token reference like "%Token%" (used in
    #                        AMD WHQL universal display drivers).
    #                        Example: "AMD SMBus" = svcS, PCI\VEN_1022&DEV_790B
    #                        Example: "%D1638.1%" = svcS, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_1638
    #
    #   (c) BareIdent -- bare identifier (rare; seen in some
    #                        legacy AMD universal INFs). Must NOT be
    #                        a known INF directive keyword.
    #                        Example: D1638 = svcS, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_1638
    #
    # Defense-in-depth (three checks):
    #   1. Skip lines whose LHS is a known directive keyword
    #      (AddService, AddReg, CopyFiles,...). This protects against
    #      DDInstall sections that share the manufacturer's name prefix.
    #   2. Each LHS form is matched by a SEPARATE regex - we don't
    #      try to consolidate them into one pattern (alternation in
    #      a single regex made the rules harder to reason about).
    #   3. Require the RHS to have AT LEAST a comma separating
    #      install-section and HWID. Lines without a comma cannot be
    #      device entries no matter what their LHS looks like.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Ensure the INF's [Version] section contains a CatalogFile entry.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Microsoft inbox drivers (such as bthpan) typically ship without
        a CatalogFile entry in the INF [Version] section because
        Microsoft uses a centralized OS-wide catalog mechanism rather
        than per-INF .cat files. When this script patches such an INF
        and asks inf2cat to re-catalog it, two things break:

          (a) inf2cat rejects the INF with rule 22.9.4:
                "Missing AMD64 CatalogFile entry from [Version] section"
          (b) Even if a .cat is produced by makecat fallback, pnputil
              / SetupAPI cannot bind the catalog to the driver package
              at install time without an explicit CatalogFile pointer.

        This function inspects the INF and, if no CatalogFile entry
        is present, inserts `CatalogFile = <name>` immediately after
        the `[Version]` section header. Existing entries are preserved
        and original encoding (UTF-16 LE BOM / UTF-8 BOM / ANSI) is
        round-tripped via Read-InfFile.

        The plain `CatalogFile` form (no decoration) is intentional: it
        is accepted across all NT-family Windows builds, and inf2cat's
        rule 22.9.4 explicitly lists `CatalogFile.ntamd64`, `CatalogFile.nt`,
        and `CatalogFile` as equally acceptable. Using the plain form
        avoids per-architecture INF surgery.

    .PARAMETER InfPath
        Absolute path to the INF file to modify in place.

    .PARAMETER CatalogFileName
        Bare filename of the catalog (e.g. 'bthpan.cat'). No path - the
        catalog is expected to live in the same directory as the INF.

    .OUTPUTS

          Changed        : $true if the INF was modified

    .SYNOPSIS
        Rewrite the INF [Version].Provider field so the re-cataloged
        driver passes InfVerif rule 1204 ("Provider cannot be 'Microsoft'").

    .DESCRIPTION
        Microsoft inbox drivers (e.g. bthpan) declare `Provider = %MfgName%`
        where the %MfgName% string token resolves to "Microsoft" in the
        single locale-agnostic [strings] section. When this script
        re-catalogs the driver, InfVerif raises:

            ERROR(1204): Provider cannot be "Microsoft", must be
                         organization who authored INF.

        because Microsoft's WHQL/InfVerif policy correctly distinguishes
        the original driver author from the entity that re-signs it.

        This function performs the minimal patch required to satisfy
        rule 1204 while preserving the rest of the INF:

          1. Adds a NEW string token to [strings] (case-insensitive
             section match - handles lowercase [strings] in inbox INFs
             AND PascalCase [Strings] in OEM INFs like Intel ibtusb.inf):

                 PROVIDER_NAME = "<provided>"

             The token is inserted right after the existing %MfgName%
             entry so the file's "; Localizable" comment grouping is
             preserved. Column alignment uses 23-char left-pad to match
             the most common spacing pattern in Microsoft inbox INFs.

          2. Rewrites [Version].Provider:

                 Provider = %MfgName%   ->   Provider = %PROVIDER_NAME%

             We DO NOT touch [Manufacturer] entries that reference
             %MfgName%, because the [Manufacturer] label still describes
             the original device manufacturer (Microsoft) - that fact
             does not change just because we re-cataloged the package.

        This follows the industry-standard pattern observed in the
        23 Intel ibtusb.inf variants on a Win11 reference machine,
        where Provider uses a dedicated %PROVIDER_NAME% token resolving
        to "Intel Corporation" while MfgName/COMPANY_NAME serve other
        purposes.

        The function is idempotent: if PROVIDER_NAME is already defined
        in [strings] and [Version].Provider already points to it, no
        changes are made.

    .PARAMETER InfPath
        Absolute path to the INF file to modify in place.

    .PARAMETER ProviderName
        Display string for the resigning organization, e.g.
        'MS BthPan Inbox Driver Self-Sign (Lab, At Own Risk)'.
        Will be inserted into [strings] as the value of PROVIDER_NAME
        (quoted automatically).

    .OUTPUTS
        [pscustomobject] with:
          Changed         : $true if the INF was modified
          AlreadyPresent  : $true if PROVIDER_NAME was already defined

Refusing to run Install phases (I01-I04) on Workstation OS (ProductType=1).

This script's installation pipeline is designed for Windows Server hosts.
Running it on a Workstation Windows host (e.g. Windows 11 used as a WS2025
preview) would:
  - Import a self-signed certificate into LocalMachine\Root and TrustedPublisher
  - Deploy a WDAC supplemental Code Integrity policy
  - Replace inbox bthpan.inf with a self-signed ProductType=3 patched version
  - On laptops with BitLocker enabled: TRIGGER RECOVERY-KEY PROMPTS on next
    boot due to PSP/TPM driver displacement

Recommended:
  * Use -Action PrepareVerify -CleanWorkRoot (no system changes).
  * After clean-installing Windows Server 2025 on this hardware, re-run
    with -Action Install on the actual Server host.

If you really need to install on this Workstation host, pass
-AllowWorkstationInstall (you accept the consequences).

    .SYNOPSIS
        Rebuild $Ctx properties from artifacts already present in the
        workspace. Called from P01 to support non-Prepare run modes
        (Verify-only, Cleanup, Install-only).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Each P-phase normally writes a handful of paths and identifiers
        onto $Ctx so downstream V/I phases can use them without
        re-discovering. When the user runs -Action Verify (which skips
        P02..P09) those properties stay $null and downstream phases
        fail with misleading "run Pxx first" errors even when the
        artifacts are physically on disk.

        This helper rescans the well-known artifact slots under
        $Ctx.Paths and populates each $Ctx property only when:
          (a) the file actually exists on disk
          (b) the corresponding $Ctx property is currently $null/empty

        Result: -Action Verify against a populated workspace now
        resolves the same property set as a fresh Prepare run, while
        -Action PrepareVerify still gets the canonical values written
        by the P-phases themselves (this scan finds nothing because
        CleanWorkRoot wipes everything first, or finds old values that
        P-phases then overwrite).

        Failures are non-fatal: each branch swallows its own error,
        leaves the property $null, and lets the downstream precondition
        check raise a clear error.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Locate the bthpan inbox driver in the host's DriverStore.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Unlike the sister AMD scripts which download an installer EXE
        from amd.com, this script's "installer" is the Microsoft inbox
        bthpan driver already staged on the host at
        C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\bthpan.inf_amd64_*.

        P03 finds the most recent staged copy. The required minimum is
        bthpan.inf + bthpan.sys in the FileRepository directory.

        an earlier revision (WS2025 compatibility): the original .cat file is NO LONGER
        required to be present in the FileRepository directory. On
        Windows Server 2025 (PS 5.1.26100 family), Microsoft has
        changed the inbox-driver staging layout so the corresponding
        catalog lives in a CatRoot-side location instead of being
        co-resident with INF / SYS in FileRepository. The script's
        own P08 will regenerate the catalog via inf2cat against the
        patched INF and re-sign it in P09, so the original Microsoft
        catalog is informational only.

        Previously behaviour required a .cat in the FileRepository
        directory, which caused P03 to fail on a clean WS2025 install
        even when bthpan.inf and bthpan.sys were correctly staged.

        If neither bthpan.inf nor bthpan.sys are present (extremely
        rare; only happens on hosts where the inbox driver has been
        deliberately removed), the phase fails and instructs the
        operator to repair the install via DISM.

        After Edit-InfForServer has done Strategy A (Workstation .1 ->
        Server .3 mirror), this helper walks the [Manufacturer] entries

        For each appended decoration, it also mirrors the corresponding
        InstallSection block.

function Invoke-InfVerifValidation {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Run InfVerif against an INF file and parse the output into a
        structured result.

    .DESCRIPTION
        InfVerif is the Microsoft-official INF validator (replaces ChkInf),
        shipped under \Tools\<ver>\(x64|x86)\infverif.exe in the Windows
        Kits 10 installation. This wrapper runs it in `/k /v` (basic
        declarative driver requirements, verbose) and parses each
        `ERROR(####) ... line N: <msg>` token from the output.

        Mode selection rationale:
          - /k  : "Declarative Driver requirements" - the most lenient
                  ruleset, appropriate for inbox-driver re-cataloging.
          - /h (WHQL signature) and /w (DCH/Windows Driver) are NOT used
                  because they enforce strict requirements that Microsoft
                  inbox bthpan does not meet (it was never authored as
                  a DCH driver).

        Exit code 1627 (ERROR_FUNCTION_FAILED) is the standard "INF is
        NOT VALID" signal from InfVerif - it does NOT mean the tool
        itself crashed.

    .PARAMETER InfPath
        Absolute path to the INF file to validate.

    .PARAMETER InfVerifPath
        Optional explicit path to infverif.exe. If omitted, the function
        searches via Find-KitTool -SearchSubdirs @('Tools'). If still
        not found, the function returns a Validated=$null result with
        ToolMissing=$true rather than throwing - callers decide whether
        to treat absence as fatal.

    .PARAMETER LogPath
        Optional file path to write the full InfVerif stdout/stderr to.

    .PARAMETER Mode
        InfVerif mode switch: 'k' (default), 'w', 'u', 'h', or '' for
        default (no mode = baseline syntax). Only one mode is allowed
        by InfVerif itself.

    .OUTPUTS
        [pscustomobject] with:
          ToolMissing    : $true if infverif.exe could not be located
          InfVerifPath   : path used (or $null if missing)
          ExitCode       : raw exit code from infverif.exe

        inf2cat performs a "Signability test" before producing a catalog.
        For Microsoft inbox drivers, that test fires the Windows 10/Server
        10 file-redistribution rule (22.9.8) on any file owned by Microsoft
        (e.g. bthpan.sys), and refuses to produce the catalog. The
        Signability test is not skippable via any inf2cat switch.

        makecat is the lower-level catalog tool. It consumes a CDF
        (Catalog Definition File) and emits a .cat directly without
        running the Logo / Signability test, which is exactly what we
        need for re-cataloging an inbox driver.

        This function:
          1. Enumerates all files in $PatchedDir that should be
             attested by the catalog (INF + driver binaries).
          2. Generates a CDF in $PatchedDir referencing those files
             with relative paths.
          3. Invokes makecat -v <cdf> from $PatchedDir, capturing
             stdout/stderr to $LogPath.
          4. Verifies the expected .cat was produced.

        OS attribution: CATATTR1=0x10010001:OSAttr:2:10.0 covers all
        NT 10.0 Server SKUs (Server 2016/2019/2022/2025). The "2:"
        prefix is the Server-family selector; "10.0" matches builds
        14393 (2016), 17763 (2019), 20348 (2022), 26100 (2025).

    .PARAMETER PatchedDir
        Directory containing the patched INF, driver SYS, and where the
        CDF and resulting CAT will be written.

    .PARAMETER InfName
        Bare filename of the INF (e.g. 'bthpan.inf').

    .PARAMETER CatalogName
        Bare filename of the output catalog (e.g. 'bthpan.cat').

    .PARAMETER LogPath
        Path to write makecat's combined stdout/stderr log.

    .PARAMETER HardwareId
        Optional HWID for catalog HWID1 attribute (helps PnP match the
        catalog to the device). Pass empty string to omit.

        Unlike the AMD chipset script which has to reason about

        there is ONE driver (bthpan.inf) and at most a handful of
        BTH\MS_BTHPAN device instances. The analysis focuses on:

          1. Current device state (Unknown / Phantom / True / Other)
          2. Runtime artifact readiness (sys file, service key, NetAdapter)
          3. Predicted post-install state
          4. UEFI Secure Boot baseline (informational)

    .SYNOPSIS
        Last-resort rebind cascade. Activates only when I04 reported
        'PartialOrPhantom' (a real, post-[B]-detection failure).
    .DESCRIPTION
        I04's improved detection ([B]: Net-class child fallback) eliminates
        false negatives caused by the modern detached-shell topology.
        When I04 STILL cannot find a true binding, the host has a
        legitimate stuck state. I05 escalates through four rebind
        strategies, re-running I04's detection after each to short-
        circuit on first success.

        Strategy ladder (gentle -> aggressive):
          Attempt 1: Restart-PnpDevice                       (WS2019+)
          Attempt 2: Disable + Enable PnpDevice              (WS2019+)
          Attempt 3: pnputil /remove-device + /scan-devices  (all WS)
          Attempt 4: Stop + Start BthPan service             (all WS)

        Capability detection (Get-RebindCapability) selects available
        attempts; missing cmdlets are gracefully skipped to support
        WS2016 where Restart-PnpDevice may be absent.

        Skip conditions (immediate no-op):
          - I04 has not run                          -> warn + skip
          - I04 result is 'TrueResolution'           -> no work needed
          - I04 result is 'NoDevice'                 -> no device to rebind
