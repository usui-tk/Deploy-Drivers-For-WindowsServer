.SYNOPSIS
    AMD Chipset Driver Build/Verify/Install deployment pipeline for
    Windows Server 2016 / 2019 / 2022 / 2025.

.DESCRIPTION
    21-phase pipeline that takes the AMD Chipset Driver installer
    (designed for Client SKUs) and deploys it on a Windows SERVER SKU
    that does NOT officially support these drivers. The pipeline:

      Build (P00..P09): Download + extract the AMD installer, patch
                        every INF with ProductType=3 / NTamd64 server
                        decorations, generate fresh catalogs with
                        inf2cat, and sign them with a SELF-SIGNED code-
                        signing certificate created by this script.

      Verify (V01..V06): Confirm the build's correctness - certificate
                         chain, catalog signatures, INF decorations -
                         then dry-run the install phases and produce
                         a per-device AS-IS / TO-BE comparison with
                         driver-source categorization ([A] Microsoft,
                         [B] Vendor, [C] Self-signed) and version-
                         aware install decisions (UPGRADE / SKIP-newer
                         / NEW-INSTALL).

      Install (I00..I04): Trust the cert into LocalMachine\Root +
                          TrustedPublisher, authorize the cert as a
                          kernel-mode signer via a WDAC supplemental
                          policy (Secure Boot stays ON, no testsigning
                          needed on WS2022+ / Win11 22H2+), call
                          pnputil per patched INF, and verify the
                          per-device disposition.

    The default authorization path is WDAC supplemental policy. Use
    -UseTestSigning only when WDAC tools are unavailable; that path
    requires Secure Boot OFF in firmware and a reboot.

    ====================================================================
    IMPORTANT: WHEN TO USE THIS SCRIPT  (read this first)
    ====================================================================
    This script produces SELF-SIGNED kernel-mode drivers. Self-signed
    drivers should be a LAST-RESORT, gap-fill measure - used ONLY for
    devices that have no working OEM- or Microsoft-signed driver.

    Recommended pre-install workflow (in order):

      Step 1.  Install official VENDOR drivers (chipset, GPU, NIC, etc.)
               from the hardware manufacturer's website. These ship with
               valid OEM signatures, are recognized by Secure Boot
               natively, and do NOT need any of this script's policy
               work. Any device a vendor driver covers is one fewer
               device this script has to handle.

      Step 2.  Run Windows Update / Microsoft Update Catalog. Microsoft-
               distributed driver updates are signed by Microsoft and
               also load on Secure Boot without policy changes.

      Step 3.  Inspect Device Manager. Confirm the count of "Unknown
               device" / "Other device" / "yellow-bang" entries - those
               are the only devices THIS script should be expected to
               cover. Devices already served by Steps 1-2 should NOT be
               replaced by self-signed drivers.

      Step 4.  AFTER Steps 1-3 are complete, run THIS script. It will:
                 - Detect remaining AMD devices that have no Server-
                   decorated driver from the official path
                 - Re-sign AMD's Client INFs with ProductType=3 added
                 - Deploy a WDAC supplemental policy that allowlists
                   only this script's self-signed cert (Secure Boot
                   stays ON; no test-mode watermark; no firmware change)
                 - Install the patched drivers via pnputil

    Why this order matters:
      - Microsoft / OEM-signed drivers always rank higher than self-
        signed ones in Windows' driver-store ranking. If a vendor
        driver is installed later, it will (correctly) supersede the
        self-signed one - so the self-signed install is wasted work
        unless we are last.
      - Self-signed drivers expand the trust surface only to devices
        we genuinely cannot solve any other way. Doing Steps 1-2 first
        keeps that surface small.
      - V06 (HardwareImpactAnalysis) and I04 (PostInstallVerification)
        in this script ASSUME the system is already in its baseline,
        properly-driven state. If you skip Steps 1-2, V06's "AS-IS /
        TO-BE" comparison will be misleading.

    ====================================================================
    Pipeline phases
    ====================================================================
    PREPARATION (idempotent, file artifacts only under -WorkRoot):
      P00 Initialize         Admin check, TLS, OS detection, env display
                             (incl. boot-signing environment summary)
      P01 PrepareWorkspace   Create / optionally clean working directories
      P02 AcquireTools       Install 7-Zip / Windows SDK / Windows WDK
      P03 FetchInstaller     Download AMD chipset installer
      P04 ExtractInstaller   Extract installer + nested archives
      P05 AnalyzeInfs        Inventory INF files into CSV
      P06 PatchInfs          Generate ProductType=3 patched INFs
      P07 CreateCertificate  Generate self-signed cert files (PFX/CER)
                             - does NOT add to system trust stores
      P08 GenerateCatalogs   inf2cat to regenerate .cat files
      P09 SignCatalogs       signtool to sign .cat files

    VERIFICATION (read-only diagnostics, no system / file changes):
      V01 VerifyArtifacts    Existence of PFX/CER/INFs/CATs
      V02 VerifyCertificate  Cert validity, EKU, private key
      V03 VerifyCatalogs     signtool /verify /pa on each .cat
      V04 VerifyInfs         INF parsing + ProductType=3 decoration check
      V05 DryRunInstall      Simulate I03 without modifying state
      V06 HardwareImpactAnalysis
                             Per-device AS-IS / TO-BE risk classification

    INSTALLATION (modifies system state):
      I00 PreInstallReview   Final review, boot-signing env, risk summary
      I01 TrustCertificate   Import cert to LocalMachine\Root + TrustedPublisher
      I02 AuthorizeDriverSigning
                             Authorize self-signed driver loading. Default
                             path: WDAC supplemental policy (Secure Boot
                             stays ON; no reboot on WS2022+). Legacy path
                             via -UseTestSigning (requires Secure Boot off).
      I03 InstallDrivers     pnputil /add-driver for each patched INF
      I04 PostInstallVerification
                             Per-device disposition + functional probe

    All preparation phases are idempotent: re-running produces the same
    output. Each phase writes a marker file when complete; with -Force
    the marker is ignored and the phase re-runs from scratch.
    -CleanWorkRoot deletes the entire working directory before starting.

    ====================================================================
    RESUME AFTER REBOOT (just re-run the same command)
    ====================================================================
    Install phases I01/I02/I03 each START by inspecting the live system
    to see if their target end state is already present. If yes, the
    phase prints "Target state already holds - skipped" and moves on to
    the next phase. This means a single command works for all stages:

        # First run (anywhere from cold start):
        .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action Install

        # If a reboot was requested, reboot, then re-run THE SAME
        # command. The script auto-detects which phases are already
        # done and continues from where it left off:
        .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action Install

    The state validators check the actual system, not just marker files:
      I01: cert presence in LocalMachine\Root and \TrustedPublisher
      I02: WDAC supplemental policy in active CI policies stack
           (or BCD testsigning=Yes for -UseTestSigning path)
      I03: every patched .inf present in pnputil /enum-drivers output
      I04: always runs (it is the verification report)

    Pending-reboot tracking:
      When I02 (testsigning path) or I03 needs a reboot to finalize,
      the script writes a sentinel under .markers\PENDING_REBOOT.txt
      with the boot-time at which the marker was written. The next
      run's I00 inspects this and reports whether the reboot has
      happened. I04 deletes the sentinel once the system is in a good
      end state.

      You don't need to track any of this manually - just re-run the
      same command after rebooting and the script does the right thing.

    ====================================================================
    COEXISTENCE WITH A FUTURE GRAPHICS-DRIVER COMPANION SCRIPT
    ====================================================================
    This script (CHIPSET) is designed to live alongside a separate
    GRAPHICS-driver script on the same Windows Server installation
    without conflict. Three design decisions enable this:

    [1] Working directory is fully separated.
        Default for THIS script: C:\Temp\Workspace_AMD-Chipset
        Default for the graphics script:           C:\Temp\Workspace_AMD-Graphics
        Default for the NPU script:                C:\Temp\Workspace_AMD-NPU
        Default for the BthPan script:             C:\Temp\Workspace_Microsoft-BthPan
        (workspaces are now relocated under C:\Temp\Workspace_*
        instead of directly under C:\. The script auto-creates
        C:\Temp itself if it does not yet exist.)
        Each workspace owns its own .markers/, cert/, download/,
        extracted/, patched/, logs/ subtrees. -CleanWorkRoot and
        -Action Cleanup operate ONLY on this workspace.

    [2] Self-signed certificate is per-script (NOT shared).
        Subject CN includes "Chipset" so the certmgr.msc display, the
        signed catalog files, and the WDAC supplemental policy all
        unambiguously identify which script the cert belongs to.
        Trust scope is per-cert: revoking the chipset cert does not
        affect graphics drivers, and vice versa. The trade-off is that
        you will see two AMD self-signed certs in LocalMachine\Root +
        \TrustedPublisher (one per category) - acceptable for lab use.

    [3] Concurrent execution is guarded.
        A workspace lock file (.markers\RUN.lock) is acquired in P01
        and held for the duration of the run. A second instance of
        THIS script against the SAME workspace will fail-fast with an
        actionable error. The graphics script uses a different
        workspace and therefore a different lock - they do NOT
        conflict at the lock level. However, BOTH scripts ultimately
        call pnputil /add-driver (in I03), and Windows allows only one
        driver-store mutation at a time. Therefore the recommendation
        for first-time users is:

            Run one script to completion (or to its reboot break),
            THEN start the other.

        For experienced users on stable hardware, running them in
        sequence within a single PowerShell session is also fine.

.EXAMPLE
    # Default: full preparation only (no system changes outside tool install)
    .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # Re-run only INF patching after editing the script
    .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 -OnlyPhases P06 -Force

.EXAMPLE
    # Wipe workspace and start over
    .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 -CleanWorkRoot

.EXAMPLE
    # After verification, deploy WDAC policy + install drivers (Secure Boot stays ON)
    .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action Install

.EXAMPLE
    # End-to-end run (prep + verify + install)
    .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action All

.EXAMPLE
    # Tear down the deployed WDAC supplemental policy and workspace
    .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Action Cleanup

.EXAMPLE
    # Capture full transcript while keeping console colors
    $ts  = Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss'
    $log = "C:\Temp\amd-chipset_PrepareVerify_$ts.log"

.EXAMPLE
    # Show formatted help inline
    .\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer.ps1 -Help

.PARAMETER Help
    Show a formatted help screen and exit. Aliases: -h, -?

.PARAMETER Action
    Pipeline mode. One of: Prepare (default), Verify, Install, All, Cleanup, ListPhases.

.PARAMETER OnlyPhases
    Run only the specified phase IDs (e.g. P05) or names (e.g. PatchInfs).
    P00 / P01 are always included implicitly.

.PARAMETER WorkRoot
    Working directory root. Default: C:\Temp\Workspace_AMD-Chipset
    (relocated under C:\Temp\Workspace_* to keep workspace data
    clustered under a single, easily-cleaned root.)

.PARAMETER CleanWorkRoot
    Delete -WorkRoot completely before running anything.

.PARAMETER Force
    Bypass cached phase markers and re-run each selected phase.

.PARAMETER LogFile
    Optional path to capture the full console transcript to a
    file. When set, the script wraps its execution in
    Start-Transcript / Stop-Transcript so the file receives every
    stream (Output / Host / Error / Warning / Verbose / Debug) as
    plain text, while the interactive console keeps its color
    decoration (Write-Host -ForegroundColor) intact. This is the
    recommended way to retain a run log without losing console
    colors — Tee-Object on the outside of the pipeline strips
    Write-Host coloring, this option does not.

    The parent directory is created on demand. The file is opened
    in -Append mode so concurrent re-runs accumulate rather than
    truncate. Recommended filename convention:
        C:\Temp\amd-chipset_<Action>_<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>.log

.PARAMETER UseTestSigning
    Force the legacy bcdedit testsigning path in I02 instead of the
    default WDAC supplemental policy path. Requires Secure Boot off in
    firmware and a reboot. Use only when WDAC tools are unavailable or
    when you specifically need a testsigning lab.

.PARAMETER References
    Display the curated list of Microsoft Learn documentation links
    that explain the prerequisite knowledge for this script and exit.
    No admin / no work. Use this switch to learn about Secure Boot,
    test signing, WDAC, INF file structure, Windows SDK + WDK, and
    PnPUtil before running the script for real.

# All URLs are en-US; for Japanese versions, replace "/en-us/" with

#
# === [1] SECURE BOOT (UEFI signature enforcement) ==================
#   Why it matters: Secure Boot is what prevents this script's self-
#   signed kernel-mode drivers from loading by default. The WDAC path
#   in I02 keeps Secure Boot ENABLED while still loading the drivers.
#

#
# === [2] TEST SIGNING / DRIVER SIGNING POLICY ======================
#   Why it matters: The legacy I02 path (-UseTestSigning) uses BCD
#   testsigning. The WDAC path is the modern alternative this script
#   prefers; this section is here for context.

#   - How to Test Preproduction Drivers with Secure Boot Enabled
#     https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/preproduction-driver-signing-and-install
#
# === [3] WDAC / APP CONTROL FOR BUSINESS ===========================
#   (formerly Windows Defender Application Control)
#   Why it matters: This is the I02 default path. The script builds a
#   supplemental policy that adds its self-signed cert as a kernel-
#   mode signer, deploys via CiTool, and reverses cleanly via Cleanup.
#
#   - Application Control / WDAC documentation root
#     https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/
#   - Use multiple App Control policies (base + supplemental design)

#   - Remove App Control policies (CiTool --remove-policy)
#     https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/deployment/disable-wdac-policies
#
# === [4] INF FILE STRUCTURE ========================================
#   Why it matters: The whole P05/P06 phase is INF-section parsing
#   and patching. ProductType=3 in the [Manufacturer] decoration is
#   what makes a Client INF apply to Windows Server.
#
#   ** PRIMARY REFERENCE for this script's core technique: **
#   - SKU Differentiation Directive
#     The authoritative document describing how IHVs use TargetOSVersion
#     ProductType to make INFs valid on Server vs Client SKUs. Defines
#     the three ProductType values:
#         0x0000001 (VER_NT_WORKSTATION)
#         0x0000002 (VER_NT_DOMAIN_CONTROLLER)
#         0x0000003 (VER_NT_SERVER)
#     And clarifies the default behavior: an INF whose [Manufacturer]
#     decoration omits ProductType (or uses an empty field) installs on
#     ALL SKUs (Workstation + Server). This is why P06's strategy of
#     ADDING explicit '...3...' mirrors works, and is also why V04 must
#     accept empty ProductType as Server-compatible.

#   - Combining Platform Extensions with Operating System Versions
#     The authoritative TargetOSVersion grammar:
#         nt[Architecture][.[OSMajorVersion][.[OSMinorVersion][.[ProductType][.[SuiteMask][.[BuildNumber]]]]]]
#     Note that each field is INDEPENDENTLY OPTIONAL - a decoration
#     like 'NTamd64.10.0...22000' (ProductType + SuiteMask both empty,
#     BuildNumber=22000) is valid and matches every product type.

#     https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-a-universal-inf-file
#
# === [5] WINDOWS SDK + WDK =========================================
#   Why it matters: P02 acquires these because P08 needs inf2cat (WDK)
#   and P09 needs signtool (SDK).
#
#   - Download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) - includes inf2cat
#     https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk
#   - Windows SDK downloads - includes signtool

# SECTION 0.25: Optional console transcript capture
#####################################################################
# When -LogFile is set, wrap execution in Start-Transcript so the file
# receives every stream (Output / Host / Error / Warning / Verbose /
# Debug) as plain text, while the interactive console keeps its
# Write-Host -ForegroundColor decoration intact. The matching
# Stop-Transcript is invoked in the top-level finally block at the
# bottom of this script; the PowerShell.Exiting hook below is a
# best-effort fallback if the script exits earlier than the finally.
#
# Tee-Object on the outside of the pipeline (`... *>&1 | Tee-Object`)
# strips Write-Host coloring because the host stream is captured into
# the pipeline value stream. The -LogFile path here is the recommended
# alternative when console coloring matters to the operator.
#
# Transcript verified activation:
#
#   Reports from PS 5.1.26100.32860 (Windows Server 2025) showed that
#   `Start-Transcript -Path X -Append -Force` raised
#   ParameterBindingException ("Parameter set cannot be resolved using
#   the specified named parameters") only when invoked from the actual
#   BthPan script body. Isolated minimal reproductions (clean session,
#   same param block in a separate small.ps1) all succeeded. The
#   root cause for the script-context-specific failure could not be
#   pinpointed within a reasonable budget; instead, takes a
#   defense-in-depth approach:
#
#     1. CAPTURE the cmdlet return value (a non-empty localized success
#        message proves the cmdlet completed normally).
#     2. POLL the log file's appearance on disk with a short timeout
#        (3 s default, 50 ms interval) - Start-Transcript opens the
#        file before returning, so a missing file means the transcript
#        did not actually start.
#     3. WRITE a probe marker via Write-Output, briefly Start-Sleep,
#        then read the file back and confirm the marker landed there.
#        This is the only deterministic way to know transcription is
#        actively capturing output (vs. silently dropping it).
#     4. STOP-TRANSCRIPT + Start-Sleep BETWEEN failed attempts so a
#        partially-initialized state from one attempt does not
#        contaminate the next.
#     5. RECORD per-attempt failure metadata (exception type, FQId,
#        message) so post-mortem diagnosis has enough material.
#
#   A failed transcript activation MUST NEVER prevent the script from
#   running its actual work. If activation fails, the script proceeds
#   uncaptured with a prominent warning and a Tee-Object workaround.
#####################################################################
# Auto-relocation guard for -LogFile vs -WorkRoot + -CleanWorkRoot
#####################################################################
# When the operator specifies a -LogFile path that resolves to a
# location INSIDE -WorkRoot AND -CleanWorkRoot is also requested, the
# P01 PrepareWorkspace phase would attempt Remove-Item on the WorkRoot
# subtree while Start-Transcript holds the transcript file open in
# write mode. That produces an IOException
# ("FileInfo: another process is using this file") partway through
# the recursive delete, leaving the workspace in a half-deleted
# state.
#
# Instead of throwing, we auto-relocate the transcript to a safe
# path (this script's own directory, falling back to %TEMP%) with a
# timestamp-suffixed filename. The user's transcript intent is
# preserved; only the LOCATION is corrected. A prominent Write-Warning
# is emitted so the new path is visible. Both the original and new
# paths are also recorded on $Script:LogFileSetup for the RUN
# SUMMARY.
#
# Trigger: $LogFile is non-empty AND $CleanWorkRoot AND $LogFile
#             resolves to a sub-path of $WorkRoot
# Target: <script-dir>\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer_<Action>_<ts>.log
# Fallback: %TEMP%\Deploy-AMDChipsetDriverOnWindowsServer_<Action>_<ts>.log
#             when script-dir is unavailable
#
# The intentional design choice is "relocate, do not refuse" so a
# benign user mistake (putting transcript next to its peer artifacts
# under logs\) does not block the run. The P01 pre-flight guard below
# stays as a defense-in-depth backstop in case this relocation logic
# itself fails to apply for any reason.

# GUID for predictability across deploys / cleanups, while still
# allowing operators to override via -WdacPolicyGuid (e.g. to clean up
# a legacy dynamic GUID, or to deploy multiple copies side by side).
#
# WdacPolicyGuidDefault: fixed UUID v4, chipset-specific so it

#                             (Windows 11 22H2+ / Server 2022+). The
#                             supplemental policy SUPPLEMENTS this

    #                                  tools (e.g. "$json | tool.exe")
    # All three must be UTF-8 for consistent round-trip behaviour.
    #
    # This is wrapped in try/catch because some pinned-redirected
    # console hosts (e.g. CI runners writing to a file with no real
    # console) may throw on the assignment; in that case the original
    # encoding is preserved and we continue without UTF-8 enforcement.

# SECTION 1b: Debug Trace Facility
#####################################################################
# A reusable diagnostic helper used to pinpoint the exact failing
# operation inside a complex function body, with three integrated
# subsystems:
#
#   (1) Trace primitives: Start-DebugTrace / Set-DebugStep /
#                           Stop-DebugTrace / Format-DebugFailure /
#                           Write-DebugFailureReport
#   (2) JSONL file output: Real-time append-only event stream to
#                           <WorkRoot>\logs\debugtrace.jsonl
#   (3) JSON Export: Point-in-time snapshot with full state,
#                           used manually and auto-triggered on phase
#                           failure.
#
# Motivation: investigation of Invoke-InfVerifValidation - the
# function raised System.ArgumentException but the stack trace only
# identified the function, not the line. By instrumenting with
# $debugStep checkpoints and a catch handler that reported the step
# name + exception type + message + script stack, the failure was
# localised to a single line (the `return [pscustomobject]@{...}`
# statement) and from there to a PS 5.1 ja-JP locale bug. This section
# generalises that ad-hoc pattern into a reusable facility that any
# function in this script (or sister scripts) can adopt.
#
# Typical usage pattern (function entry/body/catch/finally):
#
#   function Invoke-Something {
#       Start-DebugTrace -Context 'Invoke-Something'
#       try {
#           Set-DebugStep 'validate inputs'
#           ...
#           Set-DebugStep 'open file'
#           ...
#           Set-DebugStep 'parse content'
#           ...
#           Set-DebugStep 'return result'
#           return $result
#       } catch {
#           Write-DebugFailureReport $_ -IncludeStepHistory
#           throw
#       } finally {
#           Stop-DebugTrace
#       }
#   }
#
# Nesting: traces stack via Stack<object>; nested traced functions
# don't stomp on each other's state. Format-DebugFailure always
# reports against the frame that was at the top of the stack at the
# moment the exception was caught (= the function whose catch block
# is running).
#
# Phase integration: the top-level phase dispatcher loop wraps every
# phase invocation in Start-DebugTrace / Stop-DebugTrace with the
# phase ID as context (e.g. 'phase.P05.AnalyzeInfs'). Any Set-DebugStep
# inside the phase body is automatically attributed to that frame.
# On phase failure, the dispatcher emits Write-DebugFailureReport and
# triggers Export-DebugTraceJson automatically when auto-export is on.

    # Refactor for robustness on PS 5.1 ja-JP. The previous
    # implementation used inline `if/else` expressions as hashtable values
    # and a property named `host` (which collides with the PS auto-
    # variable name in some parser contexts). User report on
    # 2026-05-17 showed AmbiguousParameterSet failure when
    # -ExportTraceOnExit triggered this function from the finally block.
    # This refactor:
    #   1. Pre-computes every hashtable value into a local variable so
    #      no `if/else` expression appears inside [pscustomobject]@{...}.
    #   2. Renames the `host` key to `hostInfo` defensively.
    #   3. Uses [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)] (explicit boolean) instead
    #      of bare [Parameter(Mandatory)] which is normally equivalent
    #      but has been observed to fail parameter-set resolution on
    #      some PS 5.1 builds.
    #   4. Adds Section 1b's Start-DebugTrace / Set-DebugStep instrumen-
    #      tation so any future failure surfaces the failing step name
    #      in the JSONL stream even if the JSON export itself can't be
    #      written.

# SECTION 1c: Boot-signing environment (Secure Boot / testsigning /
# HVCI / VBS / Memory Integrity)
#####################################################################
# These helpers inspect every system-level setting that controls
# whether a self-signed kernel-mode driver can load. They are read-only
# and intended to be called from:
#   - Show-PowerShellEnvironment (P00 startup banner, compact line)
#   - I00 PreInstallReview (dedicated section with AS-IS / TO-BE)
#   - I02 AuthorizeDriverSigning (pre-check + AS-IS / TO-BE)
#   - I04 PostInstallVerification (post-reboot effective state)
#
# Why this matters for this script:
#   This script signs catalogs with a SELF-SIGNED certificate (P07).
#   Windows will refuse to load a kernel-mode driver bound to such a
#   catalog UNLESS:
#     (a) Secure Boot is OFF in firmware (UEFI setup) AND
#     (b) BCD testsigning is ON (set by I02, takes effect at boot) AND
#     (c) HVCI / Memory Integrity is OFF (otherwise CI policy still
#         enforces Microsoft-rooted signing)
#   If ANY of (a), (b), (c) is wrong, the user can run pnputil all day
#   and the driver will load briefly then be refused / reverted.
#
# Secure Boot can ONLY be disabled in firmware (UEFI setup), not from
# Windows. This script can detect, instruct, and refuse to enable
# testsigning when Secure Boot is on (because the bcdedit setting
# would be silently dropped on next boot).
#####################################################################
# SECTION 1d: UEFI Secure Boot certificate baseline
#####################################################################
# Captures the runtime UEFI Secure Boot certificate / servicing state
# and (when present) hands off to Microsoft's official sample script
# %SystemRoot%\SecureBoot\ExampleRolloutScripts\Detect-SecureBootCertUpdateStatus.ps1
# for additional fleet-rollout telemetry (BucketId / ConfidenceLevel /
# event-log counts).
#
# Why this matters for this script:
#   This script's drivers ride on top of UEFI Secure Boot. The UEFI db
#   and KEK variables hold the firmware-level trust anchors. From mid-
#   2026 onward, Microsoft is rolling out new UEFI CA 2023 certificates
#   to replace the 2011 ones that begin expiring in June 2026.
#   While our self-signed driver chain is at a HIGHER layer than UEFI
#   (Windows cert stores + WDAC supplemental CI policy), a host with an
#   incomplete or errored UEFI cert update is a meaningful diagnostic
#   signal: bootloader trust may be in flux, the Secure-Boot-Update
#   scheduled task may be running concurrently, and rollback / BitLocker
#   prompts become more likely if I02 / I03 fire in that window.
#
# Two information sources, fused via a "hybrid C" pattern (per user choice):
#
#   1. Embedded path (always available):
#        - Confirm-SecureBootUEFI + Get-SecureBootUEFI db / kek
#        - HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecureBoot
#        - HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecureBoot\Servicing
#        - \Microsoft\Windows\PI\Secure-Boot-Update scheduled task
#
#   2. Microsoft sample path (best-effort, only on devices that received
#      KB5089549 / KB5087544 / KB5088863 or the WS2025 equivalent):
#        - %SystemRoot%\SecureBoot\ExampleRolloutScripts\Detect-SecureBootCertUpdateStatus.ps1
#      Adds BucketId / ConfidenceLevel / SkipReason / event-1801-1808
#      counts that we cannot reasonably reimplement here.

# SECTION 1e: WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control)
# supplemental-policy helpers
#####################################################################
# These helpers exist to keep Secure Boot ENABLED while still allowing
# this script's self-signed code-signing certificate to load
# kernel-mode drivers. The mechanism is a WDAC "supplemental" Code
# Integrity policy:
#
#   - The base CI policy (default Windows policy) keeps enforcing
#     Microsoft-rooted signing.
#   - A supplemental policy is deployed alongside the base, ADDING the
#     self-signed cert as an allowed kernel-mode signer.
#   - On Server 2022+/Windows 11, CiTool.exe activates the supplemental
#     immediately (no reboot). On older systems, a reboot is required.
#
# Why this is preferable to bcdedit testsigning:
#   testsigning is silently dropped at boot when Secure Boot is on.
#   The user would have to disable Secure Boot in firmware - which
#   weakens the platform and may force BitLocker recovery.
#   WDAC supplemental policies are the supported, documented path to
#   "trust this additional publisher" with Secure Boot still on.
#
# Required platform components (all present on WS2022+ / WS2025):
#   - PowerShell 'ConfigCI' module (cmdlets: Add-SignerRule,
#                                             ConvertFrom-CIPolicy,
#                                             Set-CIPolicyIdInfo)
#   - C:\Windows\System32\CiTool.exe (immediate activation)
#   - WDAC AllowAll template under
#     C:\Windows\schemas\CodeIntegrity\ExamplePolicies\AllowAll.xml
#
# A marker file (Cert dir / 'AmdSuppPolicyId.txt') records the
# deployed policy ID so we can detect & uninstall later.

# SECTION 1f: Install-phase state validators (resume-after-reboot)
#####################################################################
# These predicates answer "is the END STATE of install phase X already
# present on this system?" by inspecting the live system, NOT by
# checking marker files. They exist so that an install run can be
# safely re-executed (e.g. after a reboot) and skip phases whose work
# is already in place.
#
# Why state-based, not marker-based:
#   The phase-marker files in $Ctx.Paths.Markers tell us "this script
#   ran I01 successfully in some past run". They do NOT tell us
#   whether the change is still present. If the user manually deleted
#   the cert from certmgr.msc, or someone removed the WDAC policy
#   with CiTool, or pnputil's driver-store was cleared, the marker
#   would lie. State validation reads the actual current state, so
#   skip/run is decided correctly regardless of marker status.
#
# Combined helper Test-InstallPhaseAlreadyDone is the entry point
# install phases use at their top. It honours -Force (always returns
# $false so the work re-runs).
#
# These helpers are intentionally read-only and side-effect free.

# SECTION 5: AMD URL discovery
#####################################################################
#
#=======================================================================================================================
# AMD Chipset Site Query Specification (used by P03 - URL discovery and platform detection)
#=======================================================================================================================
#
# Unlike NVIDIA's processDriver.aspx / lookupValueSearch.aspx XML API
# (a public structured API where each driver is keyed by numeric
# psid/pfid/osid/lid), AMD does NOT publish a structured public query
# API for chipset driver discovery. AMD's chipset driver distribution
# model has three exposed paths, only the first two of which are scriptable:
#
#   1. Per-platform HTML LANDING PAGE on www.amd.com that lists the
#      currently-recommended chipset driver download for each
#      socket / chipset family (AM4, AM5, Mobile, etc).
#      <-- this script PARSES these pages.
#
#   2. Direct CHIPSET DRIVER EXE URL on drivers.amd.com that landing
#      pages link to. Filename convention:
#          amd_chipset_software_<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<BUILD>.<REV>.exe
#      <-- this script DOWNLOADS these.
#
#   3. The "AMD Software Installer" Auto-detect tool - a binary
#      Windows utility that discovers the local hardware and fetches
#      drivers.
#      <-- not scriptable; not used by this script.
#
# This script therefore takes a SCRAPING approach: GET each landing
# page with a browser-style User-Agent, regex-extract every chipset
# installer URL on each page, and pick the highest-version match.
#
# === [1] Critical structural difference vs the graphics driver =====
#
#   THE CHIPSET DRIVER IS A SINGLE UNIFIED INSTALLER.
#
#   Unlike the AMD Adrenalin graphics driver - which AMD splits into
#   two parallel branches (Main / RDNA vs Legacy / Vega-Polaris)
#   that are released independently and require careful selection
#   based on detected GPU architecture - the chipset driver has NO
#   branch split:
#
#     * One installer EXE covers ALL AM4 chipsets (X570/B550/X470/
#       B450/X370/B350/A320/A520/A620 etc).
#     * The same installer EXE covers ALL AM5 chipsets (X670E/X670/
#       B650E/B650/X870E/X870/B840/B850 etc).
#     * The same installer EXE also covers the laptop "Mobile
#       Chipset" variants (which are largely SoC-internal on Ryzen
#       APUs but still ship driver components).
#     * Threadripper / Threadripper PRO platforms (sTRX4, sWRX8,
#       sTR5) use the same installer for the desktop chipset
#       components.
#
#   Consequence: there is no architecture- or codename-based branch
#   decision to make for chipset. The discovery algorithm is just
#   "find the highest-version EXE across all probed pages." The
#   platform/socket detection performed by Get-AmdChipsetPlatform
#   below is therefore PURELY INFORMATIONAL (used for log
#   transparency and audit trail) - it does NOT influence URL
#   selection.
#
# === [2] Landing page URL conventions =============================
#
#   ROOT (en-US):
#     https://www.amd.com/en/support/downloads/drivers.html
#   ROOT (ja-JP - host-locale aware):
#     https://www.amd.com/ja/support/downloads/drivers.html
#
#   Below ROOT, AMD organizes chipset products by socket / form factor:
#
#     /chipsets/laptop-chipsets/<slug>.html (Mobile)
#     /chipsets/am5/<chipset-model>.html (AM5 desktop)
#     /chipsets/am4/<chipset-model>.html (AM4 desktop)
#     /chipsets/amd-trx40/<chipset-model>.html (TRX40, HEDT)
#     /chipsets/amd-x399/<chipset-model>.html (X399, HEDT)
#
#   Default landing-page set probed by the script (see
#   $AmdLandingUrls default value near top of script):
#
#     /chipsets/laptop-chipsets/amd-ryzen-and-athlon-mobile-chipset.html
#     /chipsets/am5/x870e.html <- newest AM5 chipset (highest priority)
#     /chipsets/am4/x570.html <- legacy AM4 chipset
#
#   These three pages are PROBED INDEPENDENTLY and the highest
#   version found across all three wins. AMD typically publishes the
#   same version on all three pages simultaneously, so the choice of
#   "winner" is incidental - all three pages link to the same EXE.
#
#   Older chipset variants (X470, B550, X370, B350, etc) typically
#   redirect to or share the X570 page's downloads list, so probing
#   X570 is sufficient for the entire AM4 family.
#
# === [3] How the script extracts the installer URL ================
#
#   Step 1: Iterate $AmdLandingUrls. For each URL:
#
#   Step 2: Send GET with browser-style User-Agent header
#           (Chrome 120 / Windows). AMD's CDN serves a stripped
#           response to plain "PowerShell/5.1" UA, so this header is
#           required.
#           See: $browserUA in Get-LatestAmdChipsetUrl
#
#   Step 3: Regex-match the page body against the canonical pattern:
#               https://drivers\.amd\.com/drivers/amd_chipset_software_(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\.exe
#           See: $pattern in Get-LatestAmdChipsetUrl
#
#   Step 4: Collect ALL matches across ALL pages, attach a
#           lexicographically-comparable SortKey (zero-padded
#           five-digit per part), pick the highest.
#
#   Step 5: If no matches found anywhere, fall back to
#           $AmdFallbackUrl (a hard-coded last-known-good URL that
#           may need refreshing as AMD ages out old installers).
#
# === [4] Driver download URL pattern ==============================
#
#   AMD hosts chipset installer EXEs on:
#
#     https://drivers.amd.com/drivers/amd_chipset_software_<VERSION>.exe
#
#   Where VERSION = <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<BUILD>.<REV>
#
#   Examples (verified live 2026-05):
#     amd_chipset_software_8.02.18.557.exe (mid-2025 release)
#     amd_chipset_software_7.11.26.2142.exe (2024 release)
#     amd_chipset_software_5.12.14.0541.exe (2023 release)
#
#   The version semantics published by AMD:
#     MAJOR -- bumps roughly annually with feature drops
#     MINOR -- two-digit, bumps with minor releases
#     BUILD -- two-digit, internal build counter
#     REV -- 3-4 digit revision counter
#
#   File size is typically 35-65 MB.
#
# === [5] OS targeting (key difference vs the NVIDIA model) =========
#
#   NVIDIA's processDriver.aspx API takes an explicit osid parameter:
#       Win2008R2 = 21
#       Win2012R2 = 44
#       Win2016 = 74
#       Win2019 = 119
#       Win2022 = 134
#
#   AMD does NOT have an equivalent. A single AMD chipset installer
#   EXE supports BOTH Windows 10 and Windows 11 (and, via the SKU
#   Differentiation Directive workarounds applied by P05/P06 in this
#   script, also Windows Server 2022 / 2025).
#
#   AMD's chipset driver INF files internally branch on Windows
#   build number rather than SKU/ProductType, which is why the SKU
#   Differentiation patching this script performs is sufficient to
#   make the consumer driver install on Server SKUs.
#
#   Implication: P03 never needs to switch URL based on host OS.

# === [7] Notes on platform detection (Get-AmdChipsetPlatform) ======
#
#   This script's Get-AmdChipsetPlatform function inspects
#   Win32_Processor.Name and infers the most likely AMD socket
#   family (AM4 / AM5 / Mobile / HEDT / Server). The result is
#   logged in P03 but does NOT alter the landing-page set or the URL
#   chosen. It exists for:
#
#     - Audit trail: which AMD platform was the script run against?
#     - Triaging: if install fails, "Detected: AM5/Cezanne" tells the
#       operator which configuration matrix line to consult.
#     - Future-proofing: if AMD ever splits the chipset driver into
#       AM4-only and AM5-only branches (as they did with Adrenalin in
#       Nov 2023), this detection is the seed of the branch logic.
#
#   See: Get-AmdChipsetPlatform below.

    #   Strategy 1: 7-Zip auto-detect
    #               Works for old (6.x and earlier) self-extracting EXEs.
    #               Free, fast, no side effects. Fails cleanly on modern
    #               (8.x+) AMD bootstrappers.
    #   Strategy 2: InstallShield /a admin install + recursive
    #               msiexec /a. The AMD 8.x bootstrapper is a two-layer
    #               wrapper:
    #                 Outer: NSIS self-extracting EXE (7-Zip extractable)
    #                 Inner: InstallShield SFX in ISSetupStream format
    #                        (7-Zip CANNOT extract; only InstallShield can)
    #               This strategy 7-Zips the outer NSIS shell to get the
    #               inner SFX, then runs InstallShield /a to unpack the
    #               parent MSI + ~35 sub-MSIs, then runs msiexec /a on
    #               each sub-MSI to fully unpack the W11x64 / WTx64 /
    #               WTx86 INF tree. This is the safe, deterministic
    #               path for AMD 8.x+ installers. See the doc block on
    #               Expand-AmdInstaller_ViaInstallShield for safety
    #               analysis and OS variant mapping details.
    #   Strategy 3: launch installer with /S, watch C:\AMD\ for the
    #               extraction directory, terminate before install runs.
    #               Fragile final fallback retained for installers that
    #               are neither 7-Zip extractable nor InstallShield-
    #               based (pre-8.x proprietary formats, hypothetical
    #               future repackagings, etc.).
    #
    # Removed strategies (and why):
    #   - Bootstrapper extract switches (/layout, /extract:, -extract,
    #     --extract): the AMD 8.x bootstrapper is not WIX BURN and does
    #     not honor any of these. Every variant returns exit 2. Removed
    #     to save ~5 minutes of wasted attempts on modern installers.
    #   - "Reuse pre-existing extraction" cache: removed for clarity;
    #     run-to-run state should not implicitly leak between runs.

    # NEW EXTRACTION STRATEGY for AMD Chipset Drivers 8.x and later.

    # =====================================================================
    # WHY THIS STRATEGY EXISTS
    # =====================================================================
    # AMD changed their installer architecture starting with version 8.x.
    # The bootstrapper became a two-layer wrapper that 7-Zip alone cannot
    # fully unpack:
    #
    #   Outer layer: NSIS self-extracting EXE
    #                 (7-Zip CAN extract this layer)
    #                 +-> AMD_Chipset_Drivers.exe (inner installer SFX)
    #                 +-> auxiliary support files
    #
    #   Inner layer: InstallShield SFX (ISSetupStream format)
    #                 (7-Zip CANNOT extract - returns exit 2 silently)
    #                 (Only InstallShield-aware tooling can: /a admin)
    #                 +-> AMD_Chipset_Drivers.msi (parent, ARPSYSTEMCOMPONENT=1)
    #                 +-> Chipset_Software\AMD-GPIO2-Driver.msi (sub)
    #                 +-> Chipset_Software\AMD-PCI-Driver.msi (sub)
    #                 +->... (35 sub-MSIs in 8.02.18.557)
    #
    #   Sub-MSIs: Each sub-MSI's File table carries its driver's
    #                 binaries in three OS-variant subdirectories:
    #                 +-> Binaries\<DriverName>\W11x64\<driver>.inf
    #                     (Win11 / WS2022 / WS2025)
    #                 +-> Binaries\<DriverName>\WTx64 \<driver>.inf
    #                     (Win10 / WS2019 / WS2016)
    #                 +-> Binaries\<DriverName>\WTx86 \<driver>.inf
    #                     (32-bit Windows; never applicable to Server)
    #                 The parent MSI's admin install does NOT cascade
    #                 into the sub-MSIs (ISChainPackage is an install-
    #                 time feature, not extraction-time), so each sub-
    #                 MSI must be expanded individually via msiexec /a.
    #
    # =====================================================================
    # OS VARIANT MAPPING (informational diagnostic only)
    # =====================================================================
    # AMD organizes drivers in three OS-variant subdirectories per driver.
    # The downstream pipeline (P05 -> P06 -> I03) uses
    # Get-PreferredAmdSourceVariants -OsContext to decide which variant
    # to install per host OS:
    #
    #   W11x64 -> Windows 11-based Server family
    #              WS2025 (build 26100) and WS2022 (build 20348).
    #              Kernel-equivalent to Win11; supports modern features
    #              (Pluton, PMF AI series, 3D V-Cache optimizer, USB4,
    #              etc.) only this branch carries.
    #
    #   WTx64 -> Windows 10-based Server family
    #              WS2019 (build 17763) and WS2016 (build 14393).
    #              Threshold / Redstone ABI; lacks newer-platform
    #              device coverage; older kernel-compatible builds.
    #
    #   WTx86 -> 32-bit Windows; never applicable to Server SKUs.
    #              We extract it for completeness but P05 skips it on
    #              all Server hosts.
    #
    # This function extracts ALL THREE variants and lets the pipeline
    # pick. That isolation keeps the extraction format-agnostic: future
    # host OS changes (e.g. a hypothetical Windows 12 / WS2028) can be
    # served by updating Get-PreferredAmdSourceVariants alone, without
    # touching this function.
    #
    # =====================================================================
    # WHY THIS IS SAFE (no drivers installed during extraction)
    # =====================================================================
    # Both InstallShield /a and msiexec /a are designed to extract MSI
    # contents WITHOUT running install-side CustomActions:
    #
    #   - /a runs AdminExecuteSequence (limited to file copy and
    #     property operations).
    #   - /a does NOT run InstallExecuteSequence (where the
    #     driver-registration logic lives, e.g. Install_Driver_W11x64
    #     which calls pnputil /add-driver /install).
    #
    # Empirical verification on AMD 8.02.18.557 (Renoir on WS2025):
    #   - No driver entries appear in Win32_PnPSignedDriver after /a
    #   - No C:\AMD\ side-effects
    #   - No sub-installer processes spawn
    #   - Only files are written to TARGETDIR; nothing executes

    # typically use form (a), this parser is kept in sync with the
    # graphics script for consistency and future-proofing.
    #
    #   (a) %Token% -- canonical AMD INF convention, where the
    #                        token resolves against [Strings]
    #                        Example: %D1638% = svcS, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_1638
    #
    #   (b) "Quoted lit" -- literal string in quotes, OR a quoted
    #                        token reference like "%Token%" (used in
    #                        AMD WHQL universal display drivers).
    #                        Example: "AMD SMBus" = svcS, PCI\VEN_1022&DEV_790B
    #                        Example: "%D1638.1%" = svcS, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_1638
    #
    #   (c) BareIdent -- bare identifier (rare; seen in some
    #                        legacy AMD universal INFs). Must NOT be
    #                        a known INF directive keyword.
    #                        Example: D1638 = svcS, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_1638
    #
    # Defense-in-depth (three checks):
    #   1. Skip lines whose LHS is a known directive keyword
    #      (AddService, AddReg, CopyFiles,...). This protects against
    #      DDInstall sections that share the manufacturer's name prefix.
    #   2. Each LHS form is matched by a SEPARATE regex - we don't
    #      try to consolidate them into one pattern (alternation in
    #      a single regex made the rules harder to reason about).
    #   3. Require the RHS to have AT LEAST a comma separating
    #      install-section and HWID. Lines without a comma cannot be
    #      device entries no matter what their LHS looks like.

This script's installation pipeline is designed for Windows Server hosts.
Running it on a Workstation Windows host (e.g. Windows 11 used as a WS2025
preview) would:
  - Import a self-signed certificate into LocalMachine\Root and TrustedPublisher
  - Deploy a WDAC supplemental Code Integrity policy
  - Replace OEM AMD drivers with self-signed patched versions
  - On laptops with BitLocker enabled: TRIGGER RECOVERY-KEY PROMPTS on next
    boot due to PSP/TPM driver displacement

Recommended:
  * Use -Action PrepareVerify -CleanWorkRoot (no system changes).
  * After clean-installing Windows Server 2025 on this hardware, re-run

    .SYNOPSIS
        Rebuild a SUBSET of $Ctx properties from artifacts already
        present in the workspace. Called from P01 to support
        non-Prepare run modes (-Action Verify, -Action Install
        -OnlyPhases I01).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Unlike BthPan (single bthpan.inf), AMD chipset drivers
        contain MULTIPLE INFs whose patched artifacts cannot be
        fully reconstructed without re-running P05-P06 analysis.
        This helper therefore restores only the artifacts that CAN
        be deduced from the on-disk workspace alone:
          - Cert PFX path    (Paths.Cert\AMD-Chipset-Driver-CodeSign.pfx)
          - Cert CER path    (Paths.Cert\AMD-Chipset-Driver-CodeSign.cer)
          - Cert Thumbprint  (decoded from CER via X509Certificate2)
          - Patched subdirs  (each subdir under Paths.Patched - candidates
                              for pnputil)

        Result: -Action Verify against a populated workspace now
        resolves the cert triad without re-running P02-P09.
        -Action Install -OnlyPhases I01 (cert trust import) and I02
        (WDAC policy keyed by cert thumbprint) can also use this set.

        Failures are non-fatal: each branch swallows its own error,
        leaves the property $null/empty, and lets downstream
        preconditions raise a clearer error.

        an earlier revision (2026-05-17) - ported from the BthPan sister script's
        rehydration helper, simplified for the multi-INF AMD case
        (full PatchResults / InfInventory restoration deferred).

    # EARLIER BUG (severity: high): only $needsPatch INFs were written
    # to $Ctx.Paths.Patched, which meant V03/V04/V05/V06/I03 (all of
    # which scan the patched directory) silently missed the already-
    # universal INFs entirely.
    #
    # WHY THIS WAS INVISIBLE IN GRAPHICS BUT PAINFUL IN CHIPSET:
    # The patching loop below uses `Copy-Item $srcFolder/*` which
    # copies sibling files from the patched-INF's parent folder. In
    # the graphics installer, all package INFs share one parent
    # folder (WT6A_INF\), so the side-effect copy brought every
    # related INF along for the ride and the pipeline appeared to
    # work. The chipset installer puts each INF in its own MSI
    # folder (e.g. UART\..\W11x64\, GPIO2\..\W11x64\,...), so the
    # side-effect didn't reach them. Latest 8.02.18.557 has only 1
    # of 32 W11x64 INFs requiring patching, leaving 31 INFs (about
    # 97 percent of the package) silently dropped.
    #
    # WHY MERELY COPYING IS THE RIGHT FIX:
    # An already-Server-compatible INF needs no [Manufacturer]
    # rewrite. We just need it present in $Ctx.Paths.Patched so
    # P08/P09 generate+sign a fresh catalog (the original AMD CAT
    # would still be valid, but regenerating keeps the post-P06

    # the one matching the host OS.

    # names (W11x64, WTx64) with the inf2cat /os value. The folder
    # names indicate AMD's internal source-OS classification of the
    # driver bits; the /os switch selects the catalog's TARGET OS.
    # We always target the host (e.g. Server2025_X64), regardless
    # of which AMD source folder the INF was extracted from.

    # Previously, the function fell through from Provider to Signer when
    # checking for [A] Microsoft. That was wrong: the Signer field on
    # ANY WHQL-signed Windows driver reads "Microsoft Windows", because
    # Microsoft cosigns all WHQL submissions through the Windows
    # Hardware Compatibility Program. AMD's chipset drivers, NVIDIA's
    # GPU drivers, Realtek's audio drivers - they ALL have
    # Signer="Microsoft Windows" because that's how Windows Code
    # Integrity recognizes them as trusted at boot.
    #
    # Result: a vendor driver from AMD with Provider="Advanced Micro
    # Devices, Inc" and Signer="Microsoft Windows" was being classified
    # as [A] Microsoft instead of [B] Vendor. The user reported this
    # in the V06 log (oem17.inf, oem26.inf, oem12.inf etc all flagged
    # [A] when they're really AMD-shipped vendor drivers).
    #
    # The fix: the Provider field is the AUTHORITATIVE signal of who
    # AUTHORED the driver. Signer is only useful for the [C] self-
    # signed detection (because our cert subject is unique enough).
    #

    #
    # ---- BREAKING SPECIFICATION CHANGE: category-priority override ----
    # The driver-source category now takes precedence over version
    # comparison when AS-IS and TO-BE are in different categories.
    # Category priority (highest to lowest):
    #
    #   [C] Self-signed (this script's output) = highest
    #   [B] Hardware vendor / IHV = middle
    #   [A] Microsoft (OS in-box) = lowest
    #   [?] Unknown / unsigned = treated as lowest
    #
    # Because the TO-BE driver produced by this pipeline is ALWAYS [C]
    # (we just signed the patched INFs with our own certificate), the
    # rule simplifies to:
    #
    #   - AS-IS in [A]/[B]/[?] -> TO-BE [C] WINS (install regardless
    #                                of version comparison)
    #   - AS-IS in [C] -> fall back to version comparison
    #                                (avoid pointless reinstall of an
    #                                earlier run's self-signed driver)
    #
    # Rationale: Microsoft's generic in-box drivers (machine.inf, pci.inf,
    # hdaudbus.inf, cpu.inf, display.inf, etc.) carry OS-build versions
    # (e.g. 10.0.26100.1150) that numerically dominate AMD's semantic
    # vendor versions (e.g. 1.0.47.1). Pure version comparison therefore
    # never replaces a Microsoft generic with an AMD vendor driver.
    # The operator's intent when running this script is to put AMD-
    # specific drivers on AMD hardware - so category overrides version.
    #

    #   $Current - Get-DeviceCurrentDriver result (or $null if no
    #                  driver bound)

    #   INSTALL_UPGRADE - patched INF should replace current driver.
    #                      Triggered by EITHER category-priority override
    #                      OR strictly-newer version (when both sides
    #                      are in the same category).

    #                      (same-category comparison only).

    # Decisions:

    #                     won't displace any current driver and may

    #                     INF, either by category-priority override
    #                     (AS-IS is [A]/[B]/[?]) or by strictly-newer
